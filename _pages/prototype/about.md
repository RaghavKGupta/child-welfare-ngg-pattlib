      ### What Is Child Welfare Information Gateway?
      Child Welfare Information Gateway promotes the safety, permanency, and well-being of children and families by connecting child welfare professionals, including those working in adoption and other related fields, to essential information and resources to help them address the needs of children and families in their communities.
      Child Welfare Information Gateway provides access to print and electronic publications, websites, and online databases covering a wide range of topics from prevention to permanency, including child welfare, child abuse and neglect, adoption, search and reunion, and much more.
      A national service of the Children's Bureau, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Information Gateway consolidates and expands upon the services formerly provided by the National Adoption Information Clearinghouse (NAIC) and the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information (NCCANI).
      We are the conduit through which information flows and knowledge is shared. We are not a provider of child welfare services. Instead, we provide child welfare and other related professionals with the connection to the best information and resources to help them protect children and strengthen families.
      ### Why was Child Welfare Information Gateway developed?
      Child Welfare Information Gateway was developed to achieve the Children's Bureau's vision of a single informational resource for the field covering its entire topical scope. Information Gateway aligns our services and products to better reflect our values and be more responsive to the needs and priorities of Federal, State, and local child welfare agencies. For child welfare and many other related professionals, Information Gateway is the one stop for a full continuum of timely resources, including essential information on programs, research, laws and policies, training approaches, and statistics.
      ### Whom does Child Welfare Information Gateway serve?
      We serve child welfare professionals, including those who work in adoption and other related fields. Our primary target audience includes:
      - Administrators and policymakers
      - Supervisors/direct service workers
      - Related professionals, including counselors, teachers, attorneys, law enforcement officials, and 	  others
      The general public will continue to have access to information and resources, including our factsheets for families and adoption and foster care information.
