  A card is often a subset or summary of a larger idea. It acts as an entry point to more detailed information. This summary can contain a variety of content types, such as text, images and multimedia, or buttons and links.
  An individual card is typically a member of a collection of similar cards, not a single card in isolation. A card is distinguished from others in its collection by its content, and cards are distinguished from the broader page context in form — usually with a border or a shadow.
  Finally, a card is modular. This means that you can vary the order of cards in a collection without destroying any individual card’s meaning.
