    A select component allows users to choose one option from a dropdown menu.

    When to use the select box component:
        - More than 15 options. When there are more than 15 choices in a drop-down list it can be hard to navigate with scrolling only. 
        - Limited space. 
        - Use a combo box for presenting options over radio or checkboxes when screen real estate is limited.
