   File input allows users to attach one or multiple files.
   
   When to use the file input component:
   Documents are required. Ask users to provide files when itâ€™s necessary."

specification: |
   The file input box can be set to allow the following inputs:
   - Single file upload
   - multiple file upload
   - Text or PDF only
   - Image only

   **Functionality**
   - OnClick/OnTap of input, system displays file upload. User is able to navigate their system to select a file. 
   - OR on drag and drop, the user is able to drop their file onto the input.
   - On choosing file, system then displays the chosen file amd holds it in memory. The option to "change the file" appears
   - If the user selects "change the file", the system unloads the file from memory and opens the system to navigate to a new file.
   - On submission of form, the system saves the file to the chosen location.

   NOTE: you can use the design above to try out this fuctionality

   **Error State** is a user uploads a file that does not fit the established parameters... the system displays the error state and the form is not submitted.
