overview: This variation of the select box gives people the option to remove the object selected.
description: |
    This variation of the [select](/patterns/select/) box gives people the option to remove the object selected -- as an alternative to choose the default.

    When to use the combo box component:
        - It could be used in instances where clearing the information from the box is important to the experience.
        - More than 15 options. When there are more than 15 choices in a drop-down list it can be hard to navigate with scrolling only. 
        - Limited space. 
        - Use a combo box for presenting options over radio or checkboxes when screen real estate is limited.
