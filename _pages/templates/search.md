### Search Page functionality â€“ onLoad
On page load, content is sorted by Latest Published and 15 items are displayed.
There are three types of incoming searches, canned, keyword, empty.

#### Empty -
a user submits an empty search (search from with blank input field)
In this instance, the search page is displayed without out any filters applied.

#### Keyword -
Any search using the search module, results are constrained to keyword matches.

#### Canned -
Authors should be able to create links in the site to a prefiltered search result. For this functionality to work, search terms and filters need to be added to the url.

### Page Header
_note_ [Subtopics Pages](templates/subtopic-page) has it's own page header. Please see the specifications for how that page functions.
