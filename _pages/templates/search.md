On page load, content is sorted by Latest Published and 15 items are displayed.
There are three types of incoming searches, canned, keyword, empty.

#### Empty -

In this instance, the search page is displayed without out any filters applied.

#### Keyword -
Any search using the search module, results are constrained to keyword matches.

#### Canned -
Authors should be able to create links in the site to a prefiltered search result. For this functionality to work, search terms and filters need to be added to the url.
