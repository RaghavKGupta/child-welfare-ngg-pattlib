### Still to do
- search results examples will go in this file `_includes/prototype/search-results.md` and be shared across all the pages that have search results
- configuration options should be available to display
  - result pattern types (default, event, directory)
- if time permits, pull results from CMS... otherwise use repeated dummy data
